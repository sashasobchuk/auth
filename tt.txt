Create a simple website that enables user registration and login.
On loging, display a simple string saying "hi {name} you're logged in."
The webpage will have the following fields:
- username
- name
- password
The backend will save the user into a database when registering. Then the user can login to the website using the credentials created on registration.
The backend should issue a JWT token on login.
Technology:
- NestJS for the backend
- React for the frontend
- Postgres as a database
- Use docker compose to deploy the frontend, backend and postgres
Include a Readme file that explains how to start the project
